              We invested into the latest turbocharger remanufacture equipment from British manufacturers. All turbocharger cores are balanced up to 200,000rpm using Turbotechincs high speed balancing rig.
              After final assembly, all turbochargers are flowed and calibrated using latest G3 Concepts air flow bench test. Which lets us to unsure all the turbochargers are remanufactured to a highest
              standard and allows us to speed up the work,  so most jobs can be carried out in less than 24 hours.

        Carbon build up around the variable vanes assembly of the turbocharger is a common mode of failure, restricting the movement of the actuator arm. The carbon build up around the variable vanes is commonly referred to as suffering with ‘sticky vanes’. This restriction can reduce boost pressure and can result in the vehicle being put into ‘limp mode’ by the engine management system to try to prevent further damage to the vehicle. Its commonly appears when the vehicle is going uphill, usually above 3000rpm, when engine is giving maximum boost.
        Restarting the engine allows the ECU to reset, bringing back full performance of the engine, but only until next time.
        Many people choose quick solution in form of liquid additives to fuel system. Which gives results instantly but only for a short period of time.
        And using it too often will cause DPF filter matrix to clog up and will do more damage in the long run.
        <br />
        We can offer a cleaning service for this common problem to overcome this issue.
        <br />
        Just contact us and we will order your turbocharger to get delivered to us,   where we will strip and assess unit. We will dismantle turbocharger variable vain nozzle ring into individual components, wash and sandblast them. We also file the surface of vanes to ensure it wont happen again in near future. The cost of this service is 80£ (including both ways delivery)
        <br />
        In some occasions a faulty Turbo actuator could result to the same engine problem. Should this be the case, we can replace and sometimes repair your Turbo actuator to overcome your Turbo problems.

        <h3>Turbo Technics</h3>
        <p>
          introduced the VSR Mk3 core-balancing machine in 1999, following 15 years’ production of the previous model. Within months its clever design and many unique features became the talking point of the turbocharger industry. Following worldwide acclaim, and the only VSR (Vibration Sorting Rig) to meet full factory approval by Garrett, KKK (3K BorgWarner), Holset and IHI, the machine soon became regarded as the accepted “Industry standard” for repair businesses and aftermarket re-manufacturers.
          <br />
          Core balancing is the method required by turbo manufacturers to ensure that a repaired turbocharger meets quality standards. The Turbo Technics VSR balancing machine offers a 100% quality control system which both measures and corrects turbocharger vibration throughout the entire speed range, from zero up to 250,000 rpm. This ensures quiet turbocharger operation and a longer service life.
          <br />
          Following many years in production, the Turbo Technics VSR still remains the most advanced and universally chosen turbocharger core balancing machine available. A programme of continuous development builds on this winning formula and maintains a competitive advantage over rival machines. Greater computer processing speed, network integration and an even brighter touch screen are just a few recent improvements.

      Electric Actuator Repair
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          We are able to offer Electronic Turbocharger Actuator testing and reconditioning. Our Turbo Electronic Actuator testing service involves us running your Turbocharger actuator on test rig to ensure the actuator electronic part works efficiently without error and that it can reach its full working parameters. In case of the fault within the actuator we start a repair process.  All units are delicately cleaned internally to ensure all electrical components are free of dirt which can affect the actuators ability to process information. Motor and gears are replaced with brand new parts. All the components are carefully assembled and tested again.
          The cost of a Recondition to an Turbocharger electronic actuator is £90 and includes vat and return delivery.
          Just send us your electronic turbocharger actuator well packed and with contact and shipping details, and we will contact you as soon as it is ready for shipping.
          What is Turbocharger electronic Actuator ?
          It is so called black box bolted on compressor cover of the turbocharger which is connected with bearing housing via rod.
          It offers much faster response compared to vacuum turbo actuator, due to precise reading of position of the vanes via sensor. Therefore exhaust gases can be used most efficiently, which improves engine performance and fuel economy.
        </p>
        <h3>How to know if turbocharger el. Actuator is faulty ?</h3>
        <p>
          The easiest way is to run a diagnostics of the engine via OBD plug. It should come up as overboost, underboost or turbo position sensor error.
          Fault codes: P132A P132B P139A P1952 P1953 P2263
          If diagnostic tool is not available, it is possible to check it with engine running.
          Gently accelerate and take a look if electronic actuator arm is moving while revs are changing. Actuator arm has to move inside on higher revs and return to its original position when revs are lower. If actuator is seized and not moving, most likely it is faulty. It could also be a sign of sticky vanes. Please read our article about vanes sticking.

        A turbocharger is made up of two main sections: the turbine and the compressor. The turbine consists of the turbine wheel and the turbine housing. It is the job of the turbine housing to guide the exhaust gas into the turbine wheel. The energy from the exhaust gas turns the turbine wheel, and the gas then exits the turbine housing through an exhaust outlet area. The compressor also consists of two parts: the compressor wheel and the compressor housing. The compressor’s mode of action is opposite that of the turbine. The compressor wheel is attached to the turbine by a forged steel shaft, and as the turbine turns the compressor wheel, the high-velocity spinning draws in air and compresses it. The compressor housing then converts the high-velocity, low-pressure air stream into a high-pressure, low-velocity air stream through a process called diffusion. The compressed air is pushed into the engine, allowing the engine to burn more fuel to produce more power.

        In our workshop we are able to test all our remanufactured turbochargers with G3 Concepts turbo air flow rig.
        When setting up a new/remanufactured turbo, vane setting positions are set using accurate air flow equipment, which ensures that the ‘minimum vane opening’ position is set to allow a specific mass of air flow through the vanes. If the vanes are too closed, this can cause choking of the engine and over speeding of the turbine. If it is set too large, the turbo will have too much ‘lag’ and not respond as well as it should.
        After it is tested and set correctly, we print out a test results which are included with balancing report and invoice.

        VNT Turbochargers are commonly used in most diesel passenger cars and commercial vans. The VNT stands for Variable Nozzle Turbine, which means that the internal technology of the turbocharger uses variable vanes to control the exhaust flow against the turbine blades. These types of turbo’s are also sometimes referred to as Variable-Geometry Turbochargers or Variable-Turbine Geometry Turbochargers .These turbo’s are highly efficient and very complex, as variable vanes act as a sophisticated Engine Management System used for minimising turbo lag which improves throttle responsiveness, particularly at low engine speeds. This is done by altering the direction and speed in which the gasses impact with the turbine wheel. This type of technology is used by many turbocharger manufacturers including; BorgWarner, Holset, IHI, Cummins and Mitsibushi but it is most commonly associated Garrett, the world's leading turbocharger manufacturer, who's method of incorporating "a ring of small movable vanes around the turbine wheel" is featured in millions of passenger cars and vans around the world today. We have equipment that it essential to rebuild a VNT turbos and we are happy to offer our customers rebuild service to all VNT type turbochargers including Garrett, BorgWarner, IHI and Mitsubishi starting from £190+VAT.

        While turbochargers are designed to last the life of the vehicle, things can and do go wrong. Like the engine itself, a turbocharger can only live a long and prosperous life if it has clean air and clean oil. 3 Biggest turbo killers:
        <h4><b>Oil Starvation</b></h4>
        Turbochargers can spin up to 300,000 rpm and work at temperatures of 950C. Bearings inside the turbocharger work under great stress and shaft spins inside the bearing on thin film of oil. Oil must be present at all times from first rev on the engine. Running the turbocharger without oil just for a second can cause major damage to the shaft. It is essential to ensure that the oil feed pipe to turbo is clear and clean and oil pump is supplying correct pressure of oil.
        <h5>Causes of oil starvation:</h5>
        <ul class="ui list">
          <li>Low engine oil level in sump</li>
          <li>Bent, damaged or restricted oil feed pipe</li>
          <li>Carbon deposits in the oil feed pipe</li>
          <li>Silicone or other liquid sealant blockage inside oil feed pipe and banjo bolt</li>
          <li>Incorrect oil inlet gasket restricting oil supply</li>
          <li>blocked, damaged or poor quality oil filter</li>
          <li>Worn or damaged oil pump</li>
          <li>Failure to prime the replacement turbocharger with oil</li>
          <li>Cold start up, and hot shut down of the engine</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Prevention:</h5>
        <ul class="ui list">
          <li>Do not use silicone or liquid sealants on oil gaskets as it can spread and block oil passages</li>
          <li>Clean or replace oil inlet pipes to remove any carbon deposits, sludge or other debris that can restrict oil flow</li>
          <li>Check correct oil pressure and oil supply to the turbocharger</li>

        <h4><b>Oil Contamination</b></h4>
        <h5>How oil becomes contaminated:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>An inefficient or poor quality oil filter</li>
          <li>High carbon build-up in engines quickly contaminates new oil</li>
          <li>Accidental oil contamination during servicing</li>
          <li>Badly functioning oil filter bypass valve</li>
          <li>Engine wear and tear, leaving metal fragments in oil</li>
          <li>Oil that lost its viscosity through extended service intervals</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Prevention:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Always use new oil and oil filter before fitting the new turbocharger</li>
          <li>Ensure the oil is correct specification for the engine</li>
          <li>Clean/replace oil inlet pipe and any carbon deposits, sludge or foreign objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="warning"><b><i>Contaminated oil will score the bearings and shaft, leading to rapid wear and ultimately, turbocharger failure.</i></b></h5>
        <h4><b>FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE</b></h4>
        <h5>Some sources of foreign object damage:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor or badly maintained air filters allowing particles through</li>
          <li>Damaged connecting hoses allowing particles to enter intake</li>
          <li>Gasket fragments entering intake</li>
          <li>Objects left in the intake pipe during a service procedure</li>
          <li>Debris from a previous turbocharger failure not fully removed</li>
          <li>Damaged engine parts such as fragments from injector tips, valves and pistons.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Prevention:</h5>
        <ul>

        It is important to conduct a thorough diagnostic check of the engine system to determine if the “fault” is actually the turbocharger.
        A lack of power, noisy operation, excessive smoke or oil consumption could result from a faulty fuel injection system, ECU or electrical problems, restricted or blocked air filter, a damaged exhaust system or a lubrication problem. If possible,check crankcase pressure according to the engine manufacturer’s specification.A higher than normal crankcase pressure reading may lead to oil leakage from the turbo into the inlet and exhaust systems.

        If the engine diagnostic check does not uncover any obvious cause,make sure that an extensive trouble shooting analysis is completed. Key turbocharger areas for examination include foreign objects, lack of lubrication, oil contamination, over-speeding of the turbo and excessive temperature. This is important because turbo damage can often be a symptom of an underlying problem rather than the cause itself.

        Ensure that correct gaskets are used. For example - the center hole of any gasket must be perfectly aligned with the center hole of the turbo flange. Some turbos use a threaded connector and no gasket. Some turbos use a “banjo fitting” with “banjo bolt”; in these cases, use new sealing gaskets/washers. Important Note: Do not use liquid gasket or sealants, particularly for the oil inlet or outlet since excessive material may enter the turbo, reducing or stopping oil flow.

        It is recommended that you use new air, oil and fuel filters and clean engine oil to the engine or vehicle maker’s specification. When installing the new oil filter, if possible, fill it with clean, fresh engine oil. Also, if it is accessible, back-fill the pressure line from the oil pump to the filter. This is particularly important on high mileage engines, where the oil pressure line may empty during oil changes!

        Next, install oil drain line to the turbocharger. Important Note for Steps 12-15 Pay special attention to oil feed and drain lines, which must be totally clean and have no damage to ensure unrestricted oil flow. Make sure that flexible hose liners have not collapsed internally and that the oil feed line is not too close to source of heat which may have damaged the oil feed line internally. This is common on some vehicles and difficult to detect without cutting the pipe! For this reason, we recommend fitting a new oil inlet pipe when installing the new turbo.

        Crank the engine for 10 - 15 seconds without starting the engine. If possible, disable the fuelling/ignition or use compression test mode to allow this. This helps to prime the oil feed to the turbocharger by filling the oil pressure lines, oil filter and turbo with oil before start-up. Important Note: As soon as the engine starts, the turbo will run at high speed and a lack of lubrication in these vital first few seconds can destroy a brand new turbo.

      Oil Leakage
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      Turbochargers can spin up to 300,000 rpm and work at temperatures of 950C. Bearings inside the turbocharger work under great stress and shaft spins inside the bearing on thin film of oil. Oil seals, similar in principle to piston rings, keep the oil in place for the turbine and compressor ends of the bearing housing. It needs positive air pressure inside the compressor and turbine to keep oil lubricating the bearings and prevent it leaking into the end housings. Any restriction on the inlet side will cause a vacuum that will draw oil beyond the seals at the compressor end housing. If the engine idles for long periods, the turbocharger will rotate at much lower speed which in turn results in correspondingly low air pressure. The resulting vacuum will cause oil to leak into the turbine housing. Both these situations result in oil starvation to the bearings.
      <h5>Oil leaks at the turbine end</h5>
      <ul class="ui list">
        <li>Leaks in the exhaust system.</li>
        <li>Leaks in the EGR system.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Oil leaks at the compressor end</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Blocked or restricted air intake filter. </li>
        <li>Blocked or restricted air intake pipe/hose. </li>
        <li>Air leaks on intake hoses or at the intercooler.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Oil leaks at both the compressor and turbine end</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Restriction in the oil drain pipe from the turbocharger to the engine or in the engine breather. </li>
        <li>Physical damage to the turbocharger’s rotating parts, and excessive bearing clearance. </li>
        <li>Repeated hot engine shutdowns producing build-up of carbon deposits in the centre housing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Prevention of turbocharger failure from oil leakage</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure there are no blockages or restrictions in the air and/or oil drain systems. </li>
        <li>Ensure there are no leaks in the exhaust system.</li>
